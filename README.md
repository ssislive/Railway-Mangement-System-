# 🚆 Railway Management System (C Project)

A console-based **Railway Management System** developed in **C language** using **File Handling and Matrix representation**.  
This project simulates basic railway seat operations such as **booking**, **cancellation**, and **seat status display**, with persistent data storage in a text file.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📖 Seat Booking  
- ❌ Seat Cancellation  
- 📊 Seat Layout Displayed in **Matrix Form**  
- 💾 Data stored permanently using **File Handling (`seats.txt`)**  
- 🔄 Real-time update of seat availability after every operation  

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

- C Programming Fundamentals  
- File Handling (`fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fclose`)  
- 2D Arrays (Matrix Representation)  
- Conditional Statements & Loops  
- Modular and Structured Code

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Railway-Management-System.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd Railway-Management-System

3. Compile the program:
   gcc main.c -o railway

4. Run the executable:
   ./railway

> Make sure `seats.txt` is present in the same directory as `main.c`.

## 📊 Seat Display Format

- Seats are displayed in **matrix form**
- `0` → Available Seat  
- `1` → Booked Seat  

The same format is stored and updated in `seats.txt`.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

- Practical understanding of **file persistence**
- Hands-on experience with **matrix-based data handling**
- Improved problem-solving and logical thinking in C

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add passenger details (Name, Age, Gender)  
- Multiple coach support  
- Improved UI / menu system  
- Error handling and validation
